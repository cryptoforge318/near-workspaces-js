near-workspaces
===============

Controlled, concurrent workspaces in local [NEAR Sandbox](https://github.com/near/sandbox) blockchains or on [NEAR TestNet](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/networks). Fun, deterministic testing and powerful scripting for NEAR.

This repo is setup as a monorepo. Currently it only has one package: [near-workspaces-js]. See the README for more specific info:.

  [near-workspaces-js]: ./packages/js


Quick Start
===========

Install `near-workspaces` package with npm or yarn. For now, writie test as `__tests__`. More examples are under construction and you'll be able to clone the setup to your project.
